  User logs in → receives a short-lived access token
  Access token secures all protected APIs
  When the token expires, the system automatically refreshes it
  User continues working without interruption
  ✔ Smooth user experience
  ✔ No session timeout frustration
🔹 Key Engineering & Security Practices
  Stored refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks
  Implemented token rotation to enhance session security
  Blocked token reuse after logout
  Limited access token lifespan to reduce security risk
  Used industry-standard JWT (HS256) signing
🔹 Backend Responsibilities Handled
  API authentication & authorization
  Custom middleware for protected routes
  Token generation, validation, and refresh logic
  Secure logout and session invalidation
  Error handling for unauthorized access

      🔹 Backend Implementation (Node.js)

      ⚙️ Node.js + Express were used to:
      • Create REST APIs  
      • Handle HTTP requests  
      • Manage routing and middleware  

      Key backend features:
      ✔️ URL shortening logic using unique IDs  
      ✔️ RESTful API endpoints  
      ✔️ Input validation for URLs  
      ✔️ Proper status codes and error handling  
      ✔️ Modular route and controller structure

      🔹 Database Design (MongoDB + SQL)

      📂 Two databases were practiced for learning:

      • **MongoDB** – Store short and long URL mappings  
      • **MySQL / SQL** – Practice relational storage and queries  

      Database fields included:
      • Original URL  
      • Short code  
      • Created time  
      • Access count (optional)  

      This helped understand **NoSQL vs SQL design differences**.

      🔹 Redirection Flow (Sequence-Based)

      User enters short URL  
      ⬇️  
      Server receives request  
      ⬇️  
      Fetch original URL from database  
      ⬇️  
      Redirect user to original website  

      This flow taught me how **real redirection systems work internally**.

      ✅ Backend fundamentals with Node.js  
      ✅ Express routing & middleware  
      ✅ REST API development  
      ✅ MongoDB & SQL integration  
      ✅ URL encoding & unique ID generation  
      ✅ Redirection handling  
      ✅ Error handling and validation

      🎯 Loyalty Points and Reward Optimization – Data Analysis Case Study

      This project simulates a loyalty rewards system for a betting platform, focusing on user activity analysis and reward optimization through data-driven decision making.

      🔍 Problem Statement

      The goal of this analysis was to:
      • Calculate loyalty points for users based on their activity  
      • Convert loyalty points into monetary rewards using multiple formulas  
      • Identify the top-performing users with the highest loyalty points  
      • Compare different reward calculation formulas  
      • Determine the most effective and fair reward distribution strategy  

      📊 Analysis Workflow (Sequence-Based)

      1️⃣ Collected and structured user activity data  
      2️⃣ Calculated loyalty points using predefined rules  
      3️⃣ Applied multiple reward conversion formulas  
      4️⃣ Ranked users based on loyalty scores  
      5️⃣ Visualized results for comparison and insights  
      6️⃣ Evaluated formulas to select the optimal reward model  

      📈 Key Insights

      • Identified top users contributing maximum platform engagement  
      • Highlighted differences between reward formulas  
      • Demonstrated how data analysis improves fairness and profitability  
      • Showed real-world application of analytical decision making  

      🛠️ Technologies Used

      Python – Core programming  
      Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis  
      NumPy – Numerical computations  
      Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization and comparison

    🏥 Hospital Management – Appointment Booking Case Study

    This project focuses on designing a simple hospital management system that helps patients check doctor availability and book appointments efficiently.

    🔍 What the System Covers
    • Doctor availability tracking  
    • Patient appointment booking flow  
    • Basic user authentication for patients  
    • Organized data handling for doctors and appointments  

    📩 Notification Concept
    • Email notifications for appointment confirmation  
    • Serverless email setup for scalable alerts  

    📐 System Design Learning
    • Clean backend architecture using MVC pattern  
    • Database modeling for doctors, patients, and appointments  
    • Separation of frontend, backend, and notification services  

    🛠️ Technologies Referenced
    Backend: Django  
    Database: PostgreSQL  
    Auth: Session-based authentication  
    Email Service: Serverless Framework (concept-based)  

    📘 Key Takeaway
    This project helped me understand real-world hospital workflows, backend design thinking, and how scalable notification systems are integrated in production applications.
